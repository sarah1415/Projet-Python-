The problem consists in classifying all the blocks of the page layout of a document that has been detected by a segmentation process. This is an essential step in document analysis in order to separate text from graphic areas. Indeed, the five classes are: text (1), horizontal line (2), picture (3), vertical line (4) and graphic (5).

We invite you to first explore the Notebook file and read our presentation file to have a global vision of our dataset with the data visualization and the data modelisation.

You can go  use our Flask app to play with the parameters and make predictions.
